   -> lab: remake your index page  

-> in this lab, you will use the knowledge you've gained in the section to enhance your template by adding a navigation bar (navbar).  
   -> this is a practical exercise to make your webpage layout more dynamic and structured.  
   -> you will also get hands-on experience in improving your template's design using bootstrap, which is a framework that helps you create responsive and stylish webpages easily.  

-> learn by doing  

-> inheritance in templates  
   -> inheritance allows you to reuse common structures in your templates.  
   -> this means you don't need to repeat the same html code in every page; instead, you extend a base template and define blocks that can be overridden in child templates.  
   -> make sure to extend your template with another template using the `extends` keyword to reuse the layout.  
   -> refer to the inheritance faq provided in this section for detailed guidance on using inheritance effectively. it will be useful if you encounter issues with this process.  

-> welcome message  
   -> your index page originally included a welcome message. keep it, but adjust it to ensure it fits well with bootstrap's styling and layout.  
   -> the message should now be part of a well-structured page, with appropriate use of classes and blocks to ensure it displays correctly.  
   -> hint: you may need to use a block tag to make it more flexible, allowing it to be easily inserted or modified in different child templates.  

-> your overall template should not exceed 10 lines of code. if it does, review the examples given in the section to ensure you're applying the concepts correctly.  
   -> simple and concise code is key in web development, and this will help you understand how to maintain clean, readable templates.  

-> coming up  
   -> your templates are now taking shape as real, functional webpages! great progress so far.  
   -> in the next section, you will learn how to handle errors in flask applications.  
   -> you will also learn how to customise error pages, replacing the default ones with professional, user-friendly pages that improve the user experience.
